# SE-452-Object-Oriented-Enterprise-Computing
I took this class with Dr. Atef Bader in the Spring 2016 quarter. This course focuses on applying object-oriented techniques in the design, development, and integration of server-side enterprise applications using technologies such as servlets, Java Server Pages, and JDBC. Topics include web applications, multi-tier architecture, model-view-controller architecture, database connectivity, and security.
